# MatchSumOfPermutations

Funny story about how I came about this, my mother is an accountant and needed help figuring out how one of the numbers on her balance sheet came about. That's where I come in. 
The code will ask for the size of an array of numbers, then take those numbers and ask for a sum you'd like to find. It then creates a powerset of those numbers and sums all numbers in the powerset, storing which ones match the sum you're trying to find. This means you can find all combinations of numbers in a list that sum to any given number.
